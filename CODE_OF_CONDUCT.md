# Digital Humanities Community of Practice Code of Conduct 

This community of practice is dedicated to providing collaborative and conference experiences that are free from all forms of harassment, and inclusive of all people. Small actions you can take will help us meet this goal. For instance, we suggest: listening as much as you speak and remembering that colleagues may have expertise you are unaware of; encouraging and yielding the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group; using welcoming language, for instance by honoring pronoun preferences and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns ("people," not "guys"); accepting critique graciously and offering it constructively; giving credit where it is due; seeking concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible; and staying alert to the welfare of those around you.

Likewise, it is important to understand the range of behaviors that may constitute harassment. Harassment can include unwelcome or offensive verbal comments or nonverbal expressions related to: age; appearance or body size; employment or military status; ethnicity; gender identity or expression; individual lifestyles; marital status; national origin; physical or cognitive ability; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race; or religion. Harassment can also include use of sexual and/or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; bullying behavior; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. We will not tolerate these behaviors or the encouragement of these behaviors.

Sexual, discriminatory, or potentially triggering language and imagery is generally inappropriate for any of this community's events. However, this policy is not intended to constrain responsible scholarly or professional discourse and debate. We welcome engagement with difficult topics, done with respect and care.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Jason Heppler (<jheppler@unomaha.edu>) or staff at the University of Nebraska at Omaha Libraries immediately.

Participants in this community who are asked to stop harassing or intimidating behaviors are expected to comply immediately. Those who who violate our code of conduct may be warned, sanctioned, or expelled at the discretion of the organizers.
